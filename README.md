Project: HCP-Anywhere-CLI

This is a proof of concept of a Hitachi Content Platform (HDS) HCP-Anywhere CLI. The code
was for a collegue that only had access to Python 2.7. The code does need a complete re-write
but will, at least, show how to do the following actions:

	1. login
	2. upload a file to HCP
	3. make a directory within HCP-Anywhere
	4. list the contents of a directory

I do plan to add the following option but that'll be done when I move this to Python 3.x and
rewrite it properly...

	1. Download a file
	2. Delete a file
	3. Delete a directory (including its contents)
